Create a Login pane using Java

Hey!!! 

1. This is a simple java project that is creating a login page which requests a username and password.
2. And then it performs the authentication, whether the username and password entered are similar to the data present in the database (but for simplicity in this project
we have stored them in variables).
3. If the username and password matches then your login will be successful otherwise an error message saying "INVALID LOGIN" pops up.
4. It has 3 buttons "LOGIN, RESET, EXIT".
5. In point 3 we have covered about login, Next the Reset button resets all values to null that is empties all the text boxes.
6. Finally the Exit button closes the login pane.

Created using Eclipse IDE
You need not write the whole code , can use New --> Other -->Window Builder --> Application Window --> drag, drop and edit --> code will be auto generated for the elements selected and write logic for the required  operations. ---> Happy Learning :)
